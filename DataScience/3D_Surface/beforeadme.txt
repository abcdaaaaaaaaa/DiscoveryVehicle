NOTE: This code is suitable for gas sensors measuring standard gases.

Sensor modes measuring "Standard Gases": MQ135, MQ2, MQ3, MQ4, MQ5, MQ6, MQ7, MQ8, MQ9, MQ131, MQ136, MQ137, MQ138, MQ214, MQ216

This code simulates which gas will give which ppm result at which temperature and humidity for your sensor, at which sensor percentage.
After running this code, it saves the simulation as an html file customized for each gas.

-- WARNING --
To examine the high MB html files produced by this system without interruption in the browser, use vim when opening the files. 
Otherwise, it may experience problems while working in the browser due to the high MB.

If the sensor you are working with is not listed, please check the list of "Model Gases". (ModelGraph.py)
